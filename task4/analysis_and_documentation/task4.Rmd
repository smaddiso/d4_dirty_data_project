  filter(trick_or_treating == "yes", age != "NA") %>%
  summarise(average_age_going_out = mean(age))
average_age_going_out

average_age_not_going_out <- candy %>%
  select(age, trick_or_treating) %>%
  filter(trick_or_treating == "no", age != "NA") %>%
  summarise(average_age_not_going_out = mean(age))
average_age_not_going_out
